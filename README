Description
-----------

This software includes the userspace daemons, management commands, and
database definitions for ILA.


Installation
------------

README.install contains instructions on install ILA. This is a sourceable
file on Ubunutu systems. It includes getting prerequisite packages,
cloning the ila repository, as well as a redis and iproute2 repository.
It sets of configuration for running redis. It also build the ILA
daemons, redis, and iproute2 code. Binaries and libraries are installed
in ~/quantonium/install.


Directory structure
-------------------

ILA is typically installed under the top level directory ~/quantonium. The
ILA install script (README.install) puts ILA in ~/quantonium. The
~/quantonium directory will also contain third party software.

Under the top level directory is the tree:

ila - ILA files
    src - ILA source
        ila - ILA specific source files
            ilac - Source for utility function to manipulate ILA DBs
            ilactl - Utility to start and stop ILA-M, ILA-R, and ILA-Ns
            ilactld - ILA control daemon
            ilad - ILA daemon
            redis - Redis configuration for ILA
            test - Test files for ILA
        include - various include files
        lib - libraries for ILA
            iputil - Common IP utility functions (taken from open source)
            qmodules - Python utilities for ILA
            qutils - "Quantonium utilities". This is includes dbif which
                      is an abstracted interface for the backend databases.
                      Redis can be swapped out with a different database
                      by implementing the interface for the new DB

install - Directory where ILA files are installed during build. This includes
            binaries, libraries, third party executables, etc.

third_party - Third party code. This is typically a stable snapshot of an
            upstream repository that contains required functionality for ILA
            userspace code
    iproute2 - Snapshot of iproute2 (for "ip" command, etc.)
    redis - Snapshot of redis DB source

Additional the related GTP gateway code may be installed under the top level
directory:

gw - code for ILA ready SAEGW
    vpp - VPP UP (https://github.com/quantonium/vpp.git)
    ergw - Erlang CP GW (https://github.com/quantonium/erlang.git)

For more information consult the associated READMEs

Requirements
------------

ILA requires kernel support. This should 4.15 version of Linux or later.

Additionally, ILA needs specific version of redis and iproute2. These
are installed as part of README.install script.

QDIR environment variable
-------------------------

IMPORTANT: The QDIR environment variable must be set for ILA commands to
function properly! For the typical installation (per README.install) this
would be:

export QDIR=~/quantonium/install

Utilities
---------

***** $QDIR/bin/ilac

This utility allows viewing and manipulating an ILA database (one of loc,
ident, and map).

To get help enter the command with no arguments.

Examples:

  - Show identifier database

      tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilac ident list
      17 2222::11 113
      16 2222::10 113

  - Show locator database

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilac loc list
    113 8888:0:0:113

  - Show mapping database

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilac map list
    2222::11 8888:0:0:113 * neutral-map-auto luid output
    2222::10 8888:0:0:113 * neutral-map-auto luid output

***** $QDIR/bin/ilactl

This utility starts or stops and ILA node (an ILA-M, ILA-N, or ILA-N)

To get help enter the command with no arguments.

Examples:

  - Start ILA-M

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-M start
    <<< redis startup output >>>

  - Stop ILA-M

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-M stop

  - Start ILA-R

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-R start \
                fd00:4888:2000:2062::113 ens4
    ilad: no process found
    rmmod: ERROR: Module ila is in use
    Host ::1 port 6379

  - Stop ILA-R

    tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-R stop

  - Start ILA-N

    tom2@quantonium-2:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-N start 8888:0:0:113 2222:0:0:0
    rmmod: ERROR: Module ila is not currently loaded

  - Stop ILA-N

    tom2@quantonium-2:~$ $QDIR/bin/ilactl ILA-N stop

***** $QDIR/sbin/ip

This is the common "ip" command from iproute2. There are couple subcommands of
interest for ila.

  - Show SIR to ILA translations in kernel

  tom2@quantonium-2:~$ $QDIR/sbin/ip ila list
  8888:0:0:113        2222:0:0:0          *               neutral-map-autoluid

  - Show an ILA route 

  tom2@quantonium-1:~$ $QDIR/sbin/ip -6 route get 2222::10
  2222::10 from ::  encap ila  8888:0:0:113  csum-mode neutral-map-auto  ident-type luid  hook-type output via fd00:4888:2000:2062::113 dev ens4 proto 18 src fd00:4888:2000:2062::103 metric 1024 pref medium

Daemons
--------

There are two daemons for ILA: ilactld and ilad.

ilactld is run by ILA-M. This daemon monitors the ILA ident database.
The ident database holds the identifier to locator ID mapping. This database
is intended to be populated by the mobility manager. It is dynamic, when a
device changes location the ident database entry is updated. The daemon
also monitors the loc database the contains the active locators in the
system. Each locator is keyed by an index that is used in the identifier
to locator mapping in the ident database.

When the ilactld detects a change (ie. a UE change location, was connected,
or disconnected) the daemon writes a corresponding entry in the ILA mapping
database that contains the full information for nodes to instantiate a
mapping.

The ilad monitors the ILA mapping database for changes. When a change is
detected the daemon sets ILA LWT routes in the kernel as needed. The kernel
route is a host route that indicates ILA transformation should happen and the
given locator. Mapping information also contains other parameters for
ILA transformation such as checksum neutral settings.

Testing
--------

ila/src/ila/test contains a standalone test of ILA functionality. This
emulates a mobile "network in a box" using network namespaces. Please see
ila/src/ila/test/README

Additionally, the associated VPP code base contains a test for ILA between
two hosts that is managed by VPP. test_setup-N and test_setup-R in
ila/src/ila/test are used in this test. See
https://github.com/quantonium/vpp/blob/feature/gtp-up/README.vpp
